      Education quality often lags in rural areas and correctional facilities due to funding disparities. 
      For over a decade, MIT Spokes, a student-led team committed to narrowing the educational gap in 
      STEM disciplines among rural, low-income, and underserved communities nationwide, has cycled 
      cross-country, delivering STEM workshops to elevate aspirations and provide resources. 
      Spokes implements hands-on learning kits during one-day festivals, tailored to community needs. 
      By engaging with stakeholders and refining their approach, Spokes aims to maximize impact and 
      open opportunities for students unfamiliar with institutions like MIT.

      <p class="abstract">
        Spokes sends a team of 8 MIT students on a cross-country bike ride starting on the steps 
        of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. and ending at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. 
        Over the course of 80 days, our team will bike over 4,000 miles and host Learning Festivals in small 
        towns and correctional facilities. We create curriculums that complement each host's curriculum inspired 
        by MIT's hands-on approach to education. We teach these workshops to schools, libraries, and summer camps 
        all across the United States. We establish strong connections with communities, students, and host families 
        along the way. We document our experiences. We sweat (a lot). We become a family.
        <br>
        <br>
        Two curriculum workshops for our learning festival, <strong> Krispie Koncrete </strong>and <strong>Sustainable Manufacturing</strong>, 
        are sponsored by the <strong>Jameel World Education Lab Innovation Grant </strong> and <strong>MIT Open Learning</strong>, with the support of Professor J. Kim Vandiver.
        <br> <br><strong>Krispie Koncrete</strong> leads students through the story of concrete, touching on its history, chemical makeup, importance, and future. 
        Students engage in hands-on activities to understand concrete chemistry, see concrete being made, and be able 
        to recreate one of the key chemical reactions that leads to more sustainable concrete. Concrete is one of the most 
        prevalent materials and is essential in our industrial world. Concrete is the second most used substance in our world 
        (besides water), and contributes to approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. 
        <br> <br> <strong>Sustainable Manufacturing</strong> leads students to understand the environmental impact of conventional materials 
        versus sustainable alternatives. The course leads students through the principles of additive manufacturing including
         infill, supports, and slicing. Students then develop practical skills by working with computer-aided design tools and 
         importing to a 3D printer. Studenta anlyze the properties of sustainable materials and evaluate their suitability for 
         various applications.
         <br> <br>
        Both workshops are open source and were run in a 2-week workshop at MIT in parallel to the Spokes' learning festivals. 
        They are part of a longitudinal study on community-based learning festivals and open, portable toolkits.
