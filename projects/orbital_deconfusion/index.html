        Raw images to processed images to object deconfusion to orbit determination pipeline.
        We deconfuse candidates by taking pairs by geometric, then numerical solutions, later pruning
        into mutually consistent combinations and choosing the best combination. We use 10,000 planetary samples
        for testing.

      <p class="abstract">
        A key aspect of the search for Earth-like exoplanets with direct imaging is determining if 
        the exoplanet is in the habitable zone. Future direct imaging mission concepts such as 
        HabEx and LUVOIR require an efficient cadence of observations. Previous work shows that 
        a minimum of three epochs, spanning more than half a period, can determine orbital parameters 
        to 10% for a single, circular orbit. Multi-planet systems may require a different number and 
        cadence of observations. We begin to address the multi-planet minimum observation approach 
        by considering only the astrometric data of exoplanet candidate objects in high contrast images. 
        Existing multi-planet trajectory matching libraries such as “Orbits For The Impatient” (OFTI) 
        currently require users to specify which point sources belong to which planet and assumes that 
        the user has already matched true- positive detections to planets. Additionally, planet matching 
        needs to be considered when assessing the impact of observation scheduling on trajectory estimation 
        accuracy. To address this need for fitting orbits to multiple objects with limited knowledge, we 
        present an approach using a Monte Carlo study of different observation schedules and planetary 
        systems in which we have developed an algorithm to automatically match observations to planets, 
        and then check the accuracy of the matches. With a large number of cases, we can constrain the 
        number of observations and the spacing necessary to “deconfuse” the detections. We present 
        preliminary planet matching success rates for different observing schedules and planetary 
        system parameters. We use these results to assess the scope of the confusion problem and discuss 
        potential mitigation strategies.
