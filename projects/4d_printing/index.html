        Our machine has two modes of operation: pulling and direct "ink" write extrusion. 
        The pulling mode enables long, "infinite" threads of LCE thanks to a continuous rotation
        and collection spool. Applications of the thread include knitting for advanced
        dynamics. The direct write mode allows for custom shapes and patterns to emerge with print 
        path orientation. All extrusions must be continuously heated, with the entire machine 
        blocked from UV light. The advantage of LCE is its application to soft robotics,
        producing a new material for actuation that has historically been stiff. Potential
        contexts for LCEs are artificial muscles and wearable devices that mold to the user.
