        Mince is a monthly, affordable fine dining experience run by students for students.
        We believe that food is both an art form and a means of humble connection, which is 
        why we hope to curate unique experiences, both on campus and beyond, designed to spark 
        intimate conversation over a meal. Mince strives to build a welcoming and creative outlet — 
        a community for students passionate about the culinary arts. We are a team of hungry students 
        creating accessible, delicious, and memorable dining experiences for students in the form of <strong>pop ups</strong>* and <strong>pop downs</strong>**.
        <br>
        <br>
        *Exclusive, one-night events open for reservation to all students. The dining experiences are hosted at a unique 
        location on campus or in the Boston/Cambridge area. Consist of a three to five course tasting menu curated by the team. 
        <br>
        <br>
        **More casual dining experiences with the spontaneous spirit of a pop up ordered a la carte. Think of on-campus snack stands, 
        food trucks, and beyond: serving cheap, quality food to students.
