        A mass-efficient approach to unmanned aerial system (UAS) design and construction is achieved through the discrete 
        assembly of lattice materials. For a UAS application, the design of small unmanned aerial vehicles 
        in which discrete components can be integrated with parametrically scaled and printed components 
        enables mission-driven sizing, design, and synthesis

      <p class="abstract">
        Different UAS applications, such as military reconnaissance, 
        environmental monitoring, or commercial delivery, require different specifications such 
        as payload weight and travel range, which typically require completely different designs. 
        This means that it is difficult, if not impossible, to easily reconfigure an existing UAS 
        for a new application without the redesign and reconstruction of the system. To facilitate 
        easy reconfiguration of UAS, we present Voxelcopter, a modular construction kit for the 
        rapid-prototyping and rapid assembly of multicopter UAS. We de- velop basic viable components 
        for flight, including reconfigurable building blocks, termed functional voxels, that assemble into 
        high stiffness, lightweight structures with integrated power and data, a custom flight controller 
        software library, propellers, and power storage. In this demo, a quadcopter is assembled, and we 
        flight test the resulting vehicle, then disassemble it into components ready for reuse, 
        demonstrating the easy reconfigurability of the system.
